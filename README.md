# Bubble party

This is a simple JavaScript/HTML/CSS praticle, and the propose of this project was to use JavaScript classes

The propose was to create animated divs like these old TV's, so i'm proud of the result and i hope that you enjou :)

Bugs: i've tried to found more bugs, but that seems like 'perfect', obviously there has bilions ways to write it, some of these bilions probably are best, but in my level that's my limit, NOW, in the future i'll try to improve this code.
